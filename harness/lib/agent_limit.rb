module HiveBench
  # Detects when a candidate run hit a provider usage/credit/rate limit rather
  # than genuinely failing. A limit is not a clean exit code — it surfaces as a
  # message in the agent's stream ("you've hit your usage limit", a 429, quota
  # text). Mirrors hive's Hive::AgentLimit learning: a limit-hit cell must be
  # marked **re-run later**, never scored 0, or the leaderboard punishes an
  # agent for the maintainer's billing window.
  #
  # Biased toward false negatives: a missed limit degrades to an ordinary failed
  # cell (re-run anyway); a false positive would wrongly excuse a real failure,
  # so benign "limit" chrome is filtered first.
