  # driver itself is thin orchestration — the heavy parts are tested in U3/U4.
  #
  #   Run (U3)   -> a candidate diff (reused or fresh) + telemetry
  #   Gate (U4)  -> objective pass/fail (judged subset when no gate)
  #   Judge (U4) -> blind quality score (skipped when there's no diff)
  #   Score (U4) -> per-cell record -> aggregated results.json
  #
  # A cell that hit a provider limit (Run status "limit_hit") is NOT scored — it
  # is collected as `pending` for a later re-run, never recorded as a failure.
  # All components are injected so a pass can be driven offline in tests.
