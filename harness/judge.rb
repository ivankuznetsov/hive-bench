  # Scoring tier 2 — the blind, family-disjoint LLM judge. Grades one candidate
  # diff against the task on an absolute rubric (the reference is a *signal*, not
  # "closest wins"), with the bias defenses the research prescribed:
  #   - blind: the agent's identity never enters the prompt (the caller passes
  #     only plan + diff + optional reference; this class adds no agent id).
  #   - verbosity-neutral: the rubric instructs the judge to ignore diff length.
  #   - stability: the judge is sampled across N seeds; the result carries the
  #     mean AND a spread (stddev) so the leaderboard can mark close cells as ties.
  #   - ablation: `reference: nil` runs the reference-withheld variant (R24) to
  #     bound incumbent-anchoring.
  #
  # The judge model invocation is a seam (`judge_fn`) so the family-disjoint
  # model choice + live calls live at the edge, and tests run offline.
